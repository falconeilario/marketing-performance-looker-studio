# Marketing performance dashboard in Looker Studio
In my most recent role, I built a dashboard to track our Growth Marketing activities, marketing channel performance, and deeper insights into our contentâ€”specifically, website traffic, newsletter engagement, and LinkedIn post-performance.

The goal was to have everything in one place, easy to read, and actionable.

Since it was just a prototype, I kept things simple: I used custom reports in HubSpot to collect the right data, exported it monthly, and cleaned and processed it (automatically) in Google Sheets using some very sophisticated formulas I put together after many hours of trial and error. Once the data was structured correctly, I visualized everything in Looker Studio.

The result was a centralized, insightful dashboard that made reporting faster and decision-making easier.

[Here you can see the same dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/cef3380d-110e-46f9-85bc-90779c22be84) with some sample data I generated using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/), a great tool if you ever need realistic-looking test data.

The dashboard was built using:
- HubSpot (custom reports)
- Google Sheets (data cleaning and processing)
- Looker Studio (visualization)
